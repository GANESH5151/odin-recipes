    <p><strong>Directions To Cook</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.

            <p> 1. 2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

                2. 2 teaspoons salt

                3. ½ cup cooking oil

                4. 1 ½ cups chopped onion

                5. 1 tablespoon minced garlic

                6. 1 ½ teaspoons minced fresh ginger root

                7. 1 tablespoon curry powder

                8. 1 teaspoon ground cumin

                9. 1 teaspoon ground turmeric

                10 .1 teaspoon ground coriander

                11. 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper

                12. 1 tablespoon water

                13. 1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes

                14. 1 cup plain yogurt

                15. 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

                16. 1 teaspoon salt

                17. ½ cup water

                18. 1 teaspoon garam masala

                19. 1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

                20. 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt. Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.
        </li>

        <li>
            Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; stir to combine.
        </li>

        <li>
            Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.
        </li>

        <li>
            Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
        </li>

        <li>
            Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.
        </li>
